        <p>
            Dialogue is a major system that is used to communicate with characters and give player narration into what is happening.

        <h2>How to Create a Dialogue</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Right-click in the Project window of Unity, or go to the <strong>Asset</strong> menu at the top left.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigate to <strong>Create &gt; Asteria &gt; Dialogue</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                After selecting "Dialogue," give your dialogue a unique name (this refers to the asset in the project, not the name shown in the inspector).
                To avoid conflicts with other mods, consider naming it something like <code>MyModName_DialogueName</code>.
