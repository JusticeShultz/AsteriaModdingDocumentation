# Section 1 - Getting Started

## Overview
The modding system for Asteria consists of two main parts. First, there is the mod loader, which is a part of the game itself. It has the job of reading asset bundles. Second, there is the mod exporter. This tool takes the binary data from your mod and packs it into an asset bundle that the game can use. After creating a mod, you should place it in the designated mods folder for players to access.

The method you choose to share your mod with others is completely up to you. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, we do not have any official channels or methods for mod distribution. Whether you decide to charge for access to your mod, or publish it to a public platform is entirely your choice. It's important to understand that mod creators are the owners of their mods. This means that any issues caused by a mod, including damage to a user's game or infringement of copyright laws, are the responsibility of the mod's creator. The Asteria team cannot be held accountable for these issues or for how end-users utilize the modding tools provided. The tools we offer to mod developers are very basic and straightforward.

## Setup
Setting up the SDK (software development kit) is very simple.
